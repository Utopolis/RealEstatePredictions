This is an analysis on real estate prices with predictions. We will use neural net and linear regression, and see which method is the best. Both are fully implemented in numpy and we won't use any framework. The NN is a free inspired version from coursera course on Deep Learning, improved for regression problems.
All methods called in the notebook are wrote in ANN, LinearRegression and functions. 
Datas come from public french announcements websites which is the only way to have real time data. We will see that there is a very limited choice of features and will try to make the most realistics predictions as possible.
