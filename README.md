This is an ANN and Linear Regression implement from scratch applied to real estate predictions. This is an inspired version from coursera course on Deep Learning (for ANN), improved for regression problems. 
All methods called in the notebook are wrote in ANN, LinearRegression and functions. 
Datas came from public announcements sites and given the difficulties to have datas on real estate predicitons, we will try to make the most realistics predictions as possible, even if we have not a lot of features.
